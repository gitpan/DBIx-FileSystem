DBIx::FileSystem - Manage database tables like a filesystem

   2003  by Alexander Haderer

DESCRIPTION:
------------

from the manpage:

The module DBIx::FileSystem offers you a filesystem like view to
database tables. To interact with the database tables, FileSystem
implements a command line shell which offers not only a subset of well
known shell commands to navigate, view and manipulate data in tables, but
also gives the convenience of history, command line editing and tab
completion. FileSystem sees the database as a filesystem: each
table is a different directory with the tablename as the directory
name and each row in a table is a file within that directory. 

The motivation for FileSystem was the need for a terminal based
configuration interface to manipulate database entries which are used
as configuration data for a server process. FileSystem is neither
complete nor a replacement for dbish or other full-feature SQL shells
or editors. Think of FileSystem as a replacement for a Web/CGI based
graphical user interface for manipulating database contents.


EXAMPLE:
--------

The file pawactl shows the usage of DBIx::FileSystem. It implements 
the configure shell of a virtual package warehouse. Sample session:

----------> pawactl sample session start --------->
  pawactl (/source): ls
  (dest)          acity           factory2        lcity           
  (source)        bcity           generic         
  (warehouse)     factory1        kcity           
  pawactl (/source): cat bcity 
  #
  # Settings for SourceName 'bcity' (defaults: 'generic')
  #
  # - this is a comment, comments always start in the first column.
  # - all lines begin in the first column or are blank lines
  # - a unset variable will write NULL into the database column
  # - unset variables use the default values
  #

  #
  # SourceID
  # Internal source idenficator (4 characters)
  #
  # default: ----
  #
  SourceID = CIB

  ... more file contents ...

  pawactl (/source): sum bcity 
  SourceID     = CIB
  Distance     = 2434
  Destination  = moon
  pawactl (/source): cd dest 
  pawactl (/dest): ls
  (dest)          (warehouse)     moon            venus           
  (source)        mars            neptun          
  pawactl (/dest): rm venus
  rm: cannot remove: file 'venus' referenced by:
    source/factory2
    warehouse/sx0001
  pawactl (/dest): vi venus

     ... vi session ...
     ... save & quit ...
